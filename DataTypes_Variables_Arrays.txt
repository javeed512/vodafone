Data Types in Java:
-------------------
Primitive Data types
Names      Size      Default Value    Wrapper Class(java.lang)
byte  --   1 byte     0			Byte
short      2 byte     0			Short
char	   2 byte     single space      Character
int	   4 byte     0                 Integer
long       8 byte     0			Long
float      4 byte     0.0f		Float
double     8 byte     0.0		Double
boolean    1 bit      false		Boolean
	(true/false)  



Non-Primitive Data types / Reference Types
Any class type or interface type is known as reference type.
Employee e1;
String s1;
Object o;
Default value for any reference type is null.




In Java we have 3 types of variables based on scope
1. Local variables / Thread-Level Variable
A variable which is declare inside the block(method,constructor, forloop , while,trycatch,if)
Or variables declare as parameters

Local variable values should be initialize by the user , it can't be initialize by JVM.

2. Instance variables / Object Level Variable
A variable declare inside the class and outside all the methods or blocks without static.
Instance members can be accessible using only object references.

3. static variables / Class Level variable
A variable declare inside the class and outside all the methods or blocks with static.
Static members can be accessible using object reference or class name




class Object{



public Object(){

	// heap memory allocation
	// copy of instance vars created
	//  hashcode will generated
		

}


}


OverLoading:
=============
Overloading can place with in a same class , it is possible for methods and constructors

In Overloading names should be same but signature should be different.
We dont consider return types in overloading.

It is also known as Static or Compile time polymorphism.



Arrays:
--------
Collection of similar type of elements or homogenous elements.

int  arr[] = new int[30];

arr[0] = 101;
arr[1] = 102;
