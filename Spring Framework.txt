Spring Framework:
------------------
It consist of lots of multiple modules or  APIs , 
Core Spring module
JDBC module
Testing module
Hibernate module
Spring MVC Architecture

Spring is a open source , light weigth framework based on IOC and AOP.

DI:Dependency Injection
DI means where one object will get injected into another object.
i. Setter methods DI
ii. constructor DI 




class  Address{

 String city;

}


class Employee {

 int eid;
String ename;
Address address; // HAS A relationship

	public void setAddressAddress address){

		this.address = address;
	}


	public Employee(){

	}

	public Employee(Address address){

	this.address = address;
	}


	Employee e1 = new Employee(new Address()); // constructor DI

	Employee e2 = new Employee();
		e2.setAddress(new Address()); // setter method DI

}


IOC: Inversion of Control

Ex: Instead of Person-A , Person-B will do the work and Person-A will enjoy result.

In Spring framework , spring container or IOC Container will create object on behalf of developer and also spring container can perform dependency injections among objects.

Configurations:  // instructor

1. xml file (old out dated)
2. annotations @Bean

Spring Annotations:
===================
@Component  // pojo classes
@Service    // service classes
@Repository  // dao class or repository class
@Controller  // servlet class

@Bean          
@Configuration

@Autowire  // it is used to inject object and access objects
